## 💡 Key Insights

### **Architecture**
The application uses a **three-tier architecture**:
- **Tier 1:** Frontend (Vanilla JS) - User interface
- **Tier 2:** Backend (Node.js) - Proxy server
- **Tier 3:** Cloud (Google Apps Script + Sheets) - Data storage

### **Data Flow**
1. User input → validation
2. Save locally → immediate feedback
3. Send to cloud → async
4. Cloud processes → stores
5. Refetch → sync UI

### **Multi-Device**
Each device gets unique ID that's used to filter records in cloud.

### **Bilingual**
Hindi and English are built-in from ground up, not just translated.

### **Offline-First**
Works without internet; syncs when connection available.

### **No Dependencies**
Frontend requires only browser; backend requires only Node.js.
